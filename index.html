      <h2>Starting to raise a cat</h2>
      <p>
        Bringing home a new kitten or adult cat means you’ll need to learn some
        cat care basics. Everything from food and litter to veterinary care and
        grooming are essential. Being equipped with a basic amount of knowledge
        and having the right supplies can get you and your new cat started on a
        long and loving relationship together.
      </p>
      <h2>Select a Veterinarian</h2>
      <p>
        The first step in bringing a cat home is finding a local veterinarian
        you can trust and communicate with openly. Once you’ve decided, you can
        reach out to your cat’s veterinarian and set up vaccine appointments,
        ask vital questions and get essential tips about how to keep your cat
        happy and healthy. A good veterinarian isn’t just there to give your cat
        their annual checkups. Veterinarians are a wealth of information any
        time you’re concerned about your cat’s health, behavior or anything
        else.
      </p>
      <h2>Feeding & Fresh Water</h2>
      <p>
        Learning how to feed a cat starts with selecting the proper nutrition.
        Since kittens and adult cats have different nutritional needs, it’s
        essential to start your cat on an age-appropriate kitten food or adult
        cat food to make sure they’re getting the right nutrients their body
        needs to thrive. The amount of food you should feed your cat is usually
        located on the cat food label itself and is relative to their size and
        age. Develop a feeding routine so your cat knows when to expect they’ll
        eat. If you plan to feed dry cat food, you can put an entire day’s
        serving in their food dish every morning and let them graze throughout
        the day. If you give them wet food, it should be consumed within 20 or
        30 minutes of serving and any remaining food should be refrigerated and
        eaten within 24 hours of serving.
      </p>
      <h2>Provide Fresh Water</h2>
      <p>
        Always keep a supply of clean, fresh water for your cat to help them
        stay hydrated. Wild cats avoid stagnant water that may be home to
        harmful bacteria or parasites. As a result, many domesticated cats may
        instinctively avoid drinking water that hasn’t been replaced, so make
        sure to replace the water in their bowl daily. Choose a shallow, wide
        bowl that won’t irritate their whiskers. You can also try a
        recirculating water fountain.
      </p>
      <h2>Familiarize Your Cat With the Litter Box</h2>
      <p>
        As a cat owner, a litter box and plenty of fresh litter should be a
        priority, as should proper litter box training. Since adult cats often
        instinctually look for a sandy surface when they need to eliminate,
        litter box training might not be necessary. Kittens usually need some
        training. As early as four weeks, kittens can start to learn how to use
        the litter box. Find one that is appropriate to the size of your cat.
        For example, a kitten might find a large litter box scary and try to
        avoid it. Therefore, find one that’s a bit smaller. Introduce your
        kitten to the litter box or boxes you have in your house and let them
        explore. Then, put your kitten in the litter box. On many occasions,
        kittens will instinctively know to eliminate in this location. If they
        don’t, however, don’t worry. Continue to place them in the litter box
        after naps, after meals or drinks of water. Eventually, they’ll get the
        hang of it and start to use the litter box independently. The general
        rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat, plus one. So if you
        have two cats, you need three total litter boxes. You also want to keep
        the litter box separate from their food and water bowls.
      </p>
      <h2>Groom Your Cat</h2>
      <p>
        Although cats are excellent at grooming themselves, grooming your cat
        will be necessary from time to time, especially for longhaired breeds.
        Whether it’s nail trimming, bathing or brushing, make sure you have the
        right tools on hand to get the job done. For shorter-haired cats, you
        may need to brush your cat only once or twice a month; with
        longer-haired breeds, it may be a daily requirement. Nonetheless, when
        your cat is shedding, it’s advisable to brush them with increased
        frequency to prevent the floors and furniture from being covered in
        hair. Bathing your cat can occur less often. Cats are adept at keeping
        themselves clean; however, if your cat’s fur has accumulated stubborn
        dirt or your cat has mobility issues preventing them from grooming
        themselves, it may be necessary. Also, hairless breeds need to be bathed
        weekly to remove body oils usually absorbed by cat hair. Make sure you
        have cat shampoo on hand and plenty of treats to reward their
        cooperation. Talk with your veterinarian to get specific recommendations
        for your cat.
      </p>
      <h2>Cat Playtime</h2>
      <p>
        As an experienced cat owner can tell you, cats need to be mentally
        stimulated. Fortunately, there are plenty of games you can play with
        your cat that can give them physical and mental exercise at the same
        time while helping the two of you bond. Whether it’s having them chase a
        toy on a string that you drag across the floor, giving them a catnip toy
        or introducing them to cat enrichment games, some of the best times you
        and your cat will have together will be during playtime.
      </p>
      <h2>Cat Supplies</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, make a new kitten supply checklist to ensure you have all the
        things you need. A collar with an ID tag (even if they’re indoor only),
        bedding, a scratching post and cat carrier will be must-haves for you
        and your new cat or kitten as you start your new life together. You
        should also get your cat microchipped, just in case!
